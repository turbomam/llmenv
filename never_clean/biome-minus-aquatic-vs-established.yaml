  - prompt: Here is a report of the biome classes in the Environment Ontology (EnvO), minus the aquatic biomes
    file: biome_minus_aquatic_runoak.tsv
  - prompt: Here are some metadata (textual annotations) about all EnvO biomes
    file: biome-metadata.yaml
  - prompt: Here is a table with relationships between the EnvO biomes and other EnvO classes.
      Remember that subclass relationships are transitive and that subclasses inherit all relationship from their parent classes
    file: biome-relationships.csv
  - prompt: Here are the definitions of what NMDC calls the "MIxS environment triad" of environmental context slots.
      They can be thought of as questions about a Biosample, which should be answered with classes form ontologies like EnvO
    file: mixs_env_triad.json
  - prompt: Here are the definition of MIxS environmental Extensions
    file: mixs_extensions.json
  - prompt: Here are LinkML enumerations, representing value sets of EnvO class ids that NMDC finds to be
      appropriate for answering the MIxS environment triad questions, in the context of the MIxS environmental Extensions
    file: established_value_sets_from_schema.json
question: Examine the EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum from established_value_sets_from_schema.json,
  in which the permissible_values.texts are EnvO classes that NMDC has found to be reasonable answers for
  the env_broad_scale question in the context of a Soil Extension sample. There may be some duplication,
  and the EnvO class representation may be preceded by underscores. Make a unique, sorted list of the EnvO classes
  in a label [identifier] format, with a count of the number of multiple permissible_values.texts they appear in.
  Provide a count of the permissible_values.texts and the unique EnvO classes.
  The inputs are long so be careful not to truncate your output.
  Also consider the EnvO classes in biome_minus_aquatic_runoak.tsv and generate a similar list.
  What EnvO classes appear in the EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum but not in biome_minus_aquatic_runoak.tsv, and vice versa?
  Your answers should be sorted, in the label [identifier] format.
  What are some patterns that explain why some EnvO non-aquatic biomes have been omitted from the EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum?
  Do they have any distinguishing relationships according to biome-relationships.csv?

#  Please provide some computational artifact that could regenerate the EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum from the provided data,
#  without additional human review, preferably using the runoak command-line interface.
#  Alternative solutions could be a SPARQL query against the EnvO ontology,
#  or Python code that uses the ontology access kit library https://incatools.github.io/ontology-access-kit/.
