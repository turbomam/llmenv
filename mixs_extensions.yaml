HostAssociated:
  description: >-
    A collection of terms appropriate when collecting
    samples and sequencing samples  obtained from a
    non-human host, to examine the host-associated microbiome
    or genome.
  comments:
    - This is a very broad package, intended to capture
      many kinds of sequences derived from the bodies
      of or derived from an organism. Where possible,
      please use a more specific package. For example,
      consider using food-animal and animal feed extension
      for sampling of farm animals reared for consumption.
      For human stool microbiomes, consider MIxS-human-gut.
      Incidental associations of environmental material
      with an organism may also be better served by
      other packages. For example, nucleic acids derived
      from soil that was sampled from the hoof of a
      cow may be better described by terms from the
      soil extension; however, soil embedded in a wound
      on a cow’s leg would be best described by terms
      in this extension
